The most successful companies are often those who treat it as a new paradigm. This leads to an experimental \\u2028 mindset and an iterative approach that gets to value faster and with greater buy-in from \\u2028 users and stakeholders.\\n\\nOur approach: iterative development\\n\\nOpenAI is organized around three teams. Our Research Team advances the foundations of AI, developing new models and capabilities. Our Applied Team turns those models into products, like ChatGPT Enterprise and our API. And our Deployment Team takes these products into companies to address their most pressing use cases.\\n\\nWe use iterative deployment to learn quickly from customer use cases and use that information to accelerate product improvements. That means shipping updates regularly, getting feedback, and improving performance and safety at every step.\\n\\nThe result: users access new advancements in AI early and often—and your feedback shapes future products and models.\\n\\n4\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nExecutive summary\\n\\nSeven lessons for enterprise AI adoption\\n\\n01\\n\\nStart with evals\\n\\nUse a systematic evaluation process to measure how \\u2028 models perform against your use cases.\\n\\n02\\n\\nEmbed AI in \\u2028 your products\\n\\nCreate new customer experiences and more \\u2028 relevant interactions.\\n\\n03\\n\\nStart now and \\u2028 invest early\\n\\nThe sooner you get going, the more the value compounds.\\n\\n04\\n\\nCustomize and \\u2028 tune your models\\n\\nTuning AI to the specifics of your use cases can dramatically increase value.\\n\\n05\\n\\nGet AI in the hands \\u2028 of experts\\n\\nThe people closest to a process are best-placed to improve \\u2028 it with AI.\\n\\n06\\n\\nUnblock your\\u2028 developers\\n\\nAutomating the software development lifecycle can multiply \\u2028 AI dividends.\\n\\n07\\n\\nSet bold \\u2028 automation goals\\n\\nMost processes involve a lot of rote work, ripe for automation. Aim high.\\n\\nLet’s drill down into each of these, with customer stories as examples.\\n\\n5\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nLesson 1\\n\\nStart with evals\\n\\nHow Morgan Stanley iterated to ensure quality and safety\\n\\nAs a global leader in financial services, Morgan Stanley is a relationship business. Not surprisingly, there were some questions across the business about how AI could add value to the highly personal and sensitive nature of the work.\\n\\nThe answer was to conduct intensive evals for every proposed application. An eval is simply a rigorous, structured process for measuring how AI models actually perform against benchmarks \\u2028 in a given use case. It’s also a way to continuously improve the AI-enabled processes, with expert feedback at every step.\\n\\nHow it started\\n\\nMorgan Stanley’s first eval focused on making their financial advisors more efficient and effective. The premise was simple: If advisors could access information faster and reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks, they could offer more and better insights to clients.\\n\\nThey started with three model evals:\\n\\n01\\n\\nLanguage translation\\n\\nMeasuring the accuracy and quality of translations produced \\u2028 by a model.\\n\\n02\\n\\nSummarization\\n\\nEvaluating how a model condenses information, using \\u2028 agreed-upon-metrics for accuracy, relevance, and coherence.\\n\\n03\\n\\nHuman trainers\\n\\nComparing AI results to responses from expert advisors, grading for accuracy and relevance.\\n\\nThese evals—and others—gave Morgan Stanley the confidence to start rolling the use cases \\u2028 into production.\\n\\n6\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nHow it’s going\\n\\nToday, 98% of Morgan Stanley advisors use OpenAI every day; access to documents has jumped from 20% to 80%, with dramatically reduced search time; and advisors spend more time on client relationships, thanks to task automation and faster insights.\\n\\nThe feedback from advisors has been overwhelmingly positive. They’re more \\u2028 engaged with clients, and follow-ups that \\u2028 used to take days now happen within hours.\\n\\nKaitlin Elliott Head of Firmwide Generative AI Solutions\\n\\nTo find out more, watch Morgan Stanley: Shaping the Future of Financial Services and ask us about our Eval Frameworks.\\n\\n7\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nEvals defined\\n\\n8\\n\\nEvaluation is the process of validating and testing the outputs that your models produce. Rigorous evals lead to more stable, reliable applications that are resilient to change. \\u2028 Evals are built around tasks that measure \\u2028 the quality of the output of a model against \\u2028 a benchmark—is it more accurate? More compliant? Safer? Your key metrics will depend on what matters most for each \\u2028 use case.\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nLesson 2\\n\\nEmbed AI into your products\\n\\nHow Indeed humanizes job matching\\n\\nWhen AI is used to automate and accelerate tedious, repetitive work, employees can focus on \\u2028 the things only people can do. And because AI can process huge amounts of data from many sources, it can create customer experiences that feel more human because they’re more relevant and personalized.\\n\\nIndeed, the world’s No. 1 job site, uses GPT-4o mini to match job seekers to jobs in new ways.\\n\\nThe power of why\\n\\nMaking great job recommendations to job seekers is only the start of the Indeed experience. \\u2028 They also need to explain to the candidate why this specific job was recommended to them.\\n\\nIndeed uses the data analysis and natural language capabilities of GPT-4o mini to shape these ‘why’ statements in their emails and messages to jobseekers. Using AI, the popular ‘Invite to Apply’ feature also explains why a candidate’s background or previous work experience makes the job \\u2028 a good fit.\\n\\nThe Indeed team tested the previous job matching engine against the GPT-powered version with the new, customized context. \\u2028 The performance uplift was significant:\\n\\nA 20% increase in job applications started\\n\\nA 13% uplift in downstream success—not only were more candidates likely to apply, \\u2028 but employers were more likely to hire them.\\n\\n9\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nWith Indeed sending over 20 million messages a month to job seekers—and 350 million visitors coming to the site every month—these increases scale up to significant business impact.\\n\\nBut scaling up also meant using more tokens. To increase efficiency, OpenAI and Indeed \\u2028 worked together to fine-tune a smaller GPT model that was able to deliver similar results \\u2028 with 60% fewer tokens.\\n\\nHelping job seekers find the right jobs—and understanding why a given opportunity is right for them—is a profoundly human outcome. Indeed's team has used AI to help connect more people \\u2028 to jobs, faster—a win for everyone.\\n\\nWe see a lot of opportunity to continue to invest \\u2028 in this new infrastructure in ways that will help \\u2028 us grow revenue.\\n\\nChris Hyams CEO\\n\\n10\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nLesson 3\\n\\nStart now and invest early\\n\\nHow Klarna benefits from AI knowledge compounding\\n\\nAI is rarely a plug-and-play solution—use cases grow in sophistication and impact through iteration. The earlier you start, the more your organization benefits from compounding improvements.\\n\\nKlarna, a global payments network and shopping platform, introduced a new AI assistant to streamline customer service. Within a few months, the assistant was handling two-thirds of all service chats—doing the work of hundreds of agents and cutting average resolution times from \\u2028 11 minutes to just 2. The initiative is projected to deliver $40 million in profit improvement, all while maintaining satisfaction scores on par with human support. These results didn’t happen overnight. Klarna achieved this performance by continuously testing and refining the assistant.\\n\\nJust as importantly, 90% of Klarna’s employees now use AI in their daily work. Growing organization-wide familiarity with AI has enabled Klarna to move faster, launch internal initiatives more efficiently, and continuously refine the customer experience. By investing early and encouraging broad adoption, Klarna is seeing AI’s benefits compound—driving returns\\u2028 across its business.\\n\\n11\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\n12\\n\\nThis AI breakthrough in customer interaction means superior experiences for our customers at better prices, more interesting challenges for our employees, and better returns for our investors.\\n\\nSebastian Siemiatkowski Co-Founder and CEO\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nLesson 4\\n\\nCustomize and fine-tune your models\\n\\nHow Lowe’s improves product search\\n\\nEnterprises seeing the most success from AI adoption are often the ones that invest time and resources in customizing and training their own AI models. OpenAI has invested heavily in our API to make it easier to customize and fine-tune models—whether as a self-service approach or using our tools and support.\\n\\nWe worked closely with Lowe’s, the Fortune 50 home improvement company, to improve the accuracy and relevance of their ecommerce search function. With thousands of suppliers, Lowe’s often has to work with incomplete or inconsistent product data.\\n\\n13\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nThe key is in accurate product descriptions and tagging. But it also requires an understanding \\u2028 of how shoppers search, a dynamic that changes across product categories. That’s where \\u2028 fine-tuning comes in.\\n\\nBy fine-tuning OpenAI models, the Lowe’s team was able to improve product tagging accuracy \\u2028 by 20%—with error detection improving by 60%.\\n\\nExcitement in the team was palpable when we saw results from fine-tuning GPT 3.5 on our product data. We knew we had a winner on our hands!\\n\\nNishant Gupta Senior Director, Data, Analytics and Computational Intelligence\\n\\nProduct Note: OpenAI has launched Vision Fine-Tuning to further improve ecommerce search and address challenges in medical imaging and autonomous driving.\\n\\n14\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nWhat is fine-tuning?\\n\\nIf a GPT model is a store-bought suit, fine-tuning is the tailored option—the way you customize \\u2028 the model to your organization’s specific data \\u2028 and needs.\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\n\\nImproved accuracy\\n\\nBy training on your unique data—such as product \\u2028 catalogs or internal FAQs—the model delivers more \\u2028 relevant, on-brand results.\\n\\nDomain expertise\\n\\nFine-tuned models better understand your industry’s terminology, style, and context.\\n\\nConsistent tone and style\\n\\nFor a retailer, that could mean every product description stays true to brand voice; for a law firm, it means properly formatted citations, every time.\\n\\nFaster outcomes\\n\\nLess manual editing or re-checking means your teams can focus on high-value tasks.\\n\\n15\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nLesson 5\\n\\nGet AI in the hands of experts\\n\\nBBVA takes an expert-led approach to AI\\n\\nYour employees are closest to your processes and problems and are often the best-placed to find AI-driven solutions. Getting AI into the hands of these experts can be far more powerful than trying to build generic or horizontal solutions.\\n\\nBBVA, the global banking leader, has more than 125,000 employees, each with a unique set of challenges and opportunities. They decided to get AI into the hands of employees—working closely with Legal, Compliance, and IT Security teams to ensure responsible use. They rolled out ChatGPT Enterprise globally, then let people discover their own use cases.\\n\\n“Normally, in a business like ours, building even a prototype requires technical resources and time,” says Elena Alfaro, Head of Global AI Adoption at BBVA. “With custom GPTs, anyone can create apps to solve unique problems—it’s very easy to start.”\\n\\nIn five months, BBVA employees created over 2,900 custom GPTs—some of which reduce \\u2028 project and process timelines from weeks to hours. The impact was felt across many disciplines and departments:\\n\\nThe Credit Risk team\\n\\nUses ChatGPT to determine creditworthiness faster and \\u2028 more accurately.\\n\\nThe Legal team\\n\\nUses it to answer 40,000 questions a year on policies, compliance, and more.\\n\\nThe Customer Service team\\n\\nAutomates the sentiment analysis of NPS surveys.\\n\\n16\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nAnd the wins continue to spread across Marketing, Risk Management, Operations, and beyond. All because they got AI in the hands of the people who know how to apply it in their own disciplines.\\n\\nWe consider our investment in ChatGPT an investment in our people. AI amplifies our potential and helps us be more efficient and creative.\\n\\nElena Alfaro Head of Global AI Adoption\\n\\nProduct Note: With deep research, ChatGPT can do work independently. Give it a prompt, and it can synthesize hundreds of online sources to create comprehensive, PhD-level reports. This unlocks employee productivity and gives them access to deep, detailed research on any topic in minutes. In an internal evaluation by experts across domains, deep research saved an average of 4 hours per complex task.\\n\\nFor more detail, watch BBVA puts AI into the hands of every team.\\n\\n17\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nLesson 6\\n\\nUnblock your developers\\n\\nMercado Libre builds AI programs faster and more consistently\\n\\nDeveloper resources are the main bottleneck and growth inhibitor in many organizations. \\u2028 When engineering teams are overwhelmed, it slows innovation and creates an insurmountable backlog of apps and ideas.\\n\\nMercado Libre, Latin America’s largest ecommerce and fintech company, partnered with \\u2028 OpenAI to build a development platform layer to solve that. It’s called Verdi, and it’s powered \\u2028 by GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. Today, it helps their 17,000 developers unify and accelerate their \\u2028 AI application builds.\\n\\nVerdi integrates language models, Python nodes, and APIs to create a scalable, consistent platform that uses natural language as a central interface. Developers now build consistently \\u2028 high-quality apps, faster, without having to get into the source code. Security, guardrails, and routing logic are all built in.\\n\\n18\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nAs a result, AI app development has accelerated dramatically, helping Mercado Libre employees do amazing things, including:\\n\\nImproving inventory capacity\\n\\nGPT-4o mini Vision tags and completes product listings, allowing Mercado to catalog 100x more products.\\n\\nDetecting fraud\\n\\nEvaluating data on millions of product listings each day, improving fraud detection accuracy to nearly 99% for \\u2028 flagged items.\\n\\nCustomizing product descriptions\\n\\nTranslating product titles and descriptions to adapt to nuanced Spanish and Portuguese dialects.\\n\\nIncreasing orders\\n\\nAutomating review summaries to help users quickly grasp product feedback.\\n\\nPersonalizing notifications\\n\\nTailoring push notifications to drive higher engagement and improve product recommendations.\\n\\n19\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nNext up: using Verdi to improve logistics, reduce late deliveries, and take on more high-impact tasks across the organization.\\n\\nWe designed our ideal AI platform using GPT-4o mini, \\u2028 with a focus on lowering cognitive load and enabling the entire organization to iterate, develop, and deploy new, innovative solutions.\\n\\nSebastian Barrios SVP of Technology\\n\\n20\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nLesson 7\\n\\nSet bold automation goals\\n\\nHow we automate our own work at OpenAI\\n\\nAt OpenAI, we live with AI every day, so we’re often spotting new ways to automate our own work.\\n\\nAn example: Our support teams were getting bogged down, spending time accessing systems, trying to understand context, craft responses, and take the right actions for customers.\\n\\nSo we built an internal automation platform. It works on top of our existing workflows and systems to automate rote work and accelerate insight and action.\\n\\nOur first use case: working on top of Gmail to craft customer responses and trigger actions. \\u2028 Using our automation platform, our teams can instantly access customer data and relevant knowledge articles, then incorporate the results into response emails or specific actions—such \\u2028 as updating accounts or opening support tickets.\\n\\nBy embedding AI into existing workflows, our teams are more efficient, responsive, and customer- focused. This platform handles hundreds of thousands of tasks every month, freeing people to do more high-impact work. Not surprisingly, the system is now spreading across other departments.\\n\\nIt happened because we set bold automation goals from the start, instead of accepting inefficient processes as a cost of doing business.\\n\\n21\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nLearning from each other\\n\\nAs the previous examples show, every business is full of opportunities to harness the power of AI for improved outcomes. The use cases may vary by company and industry but the lessons apply across all markets.\\n\\nThe common theme: AI deployment benefits from an open, experimental mindset, backed by rigorous evaluations, and safety guardrails. The companies seeing success aren’t rushing to inject AI models into every workflow. They’re aligning around high-return, low-effort use cases, learning as they iterate, then taking that learning into new areas.\\n\\nThe results are clear and measurable: faster, more accurate processes; more personalized customer experiences; and more rewarding work, as employees focus on the things people \\u2028 do best.\\n\\nWe’re now seeing companies integrating AI workflows to automate increasingly sophisticated processes—often using tools, resources, and other agents to get things done.\\n\\nWe’ll continue to report back from the front lines of AI to help guide your own thinking.\\n\\nProduct Note: Operator\\n\\nOperator is an example of OpenAI’s agentic approach. Leveraging its own virtual browser, Operator can navigate the web, click on buttons, fill in forms, and gather data just like a human would.\\n\\nIt can also run processes across a wide range of tools and systems—no need for custom integrations or APIs. Enterprises use it to automate workflows that previously required human intervention, such as:\\n\\nAutomating software testing and QA using Operator to interact with web apps \\u2028 like a real user, flagging any UI issues.\\n\\nUpdating systems of record on behalf of users, without technical instructions \\u2028 or API connections.\\n\\nThe result: end-to-end automation, freeing teams from repetitive tasks and boosting efficiency across the enterprise.\\n\\n22\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nThe trusted AI enterprise platform\\n\\nSecurity and privacy at a glance\\n\\nFor our enterprise customers, nothing is more important than security, privacy and control. \\u2028 Here’s how we ensure it:\\n\\nYour data stays yours\\n\\nWe don’t use your content to train our models; your enterprise retains full ownership.\\n\\nEnterprise-grade compliance\\n\\nData is encrypted in transit and at rest, aligned with top standards like SOC 2 Type 2 and CSA STAR Level 1.\\n\\nGranular access controls\\n\\nYou choose who can see and manage data, ensuring internal governance and compliance.\\n\\nFlexible retention\\n\\nAdjust settings for logging and storage to match your organization’s policies.\\n\\nFor more on OpenAI and security, visit our Security page or the OpenAI Security Portal.\\n\\n23\\n\\nAI in the Enterprise\\n\\nMore resources\\n\\nOpenAI for Business\\n\\nOpenAI Stories\\n\\nChatGPT Enterprise\\n\\nOpenAI and Safety\\n\\nAPI Platform\\n\\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company.

When should you build an agent? Agent design foundations Guardrails Conclusion\\n\\n2\\n\\n4 5 7 24 32\\n\\nPractical guide to building agents\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nLarge language models are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks. Advances in reasoning, multimodality, and tool use have unlocked a new category of LLM-powered systems known as agents.\\n\\nThis guide is designed for product and engineering teams exploring how to build their first agents, distilling insights from numerous customer deployments into practical and actionable best practices. It includes frameworks for identifying promising use cases, clear patterns for designing agent logic and orchestration, and best practices to ensure your agents run safely, predictably, \\u2028 and effectively.\\n\\nAfter reading this guide, you’ll have the foundational knowledge you need to confidently start building your first agent.\\n\\n3\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nWhat is an agent?\\n\\nWhile conventional software enables users to streamline and automate workflows, agents are able to perform the same workflows on the users’ behalf with a high degree of independence.\\n\\nAgents are systems that independently accomplish tasks on your behalf.\\n\\nA workflow is a sequence of steps that must be executed to meet the user’s goal, whether that\\'s resolving a customer service issue, booking a restaurant reservation, committing a code change, \\u2028 or generating a report.\\n\\nApplications that integrate LLMs but don’t use them to control workflow execution—think simple chatbots, single-turn LLMs, or sentiment classifiers—are not agents.\\n\\nMore concretely, an agent possesses core characteristics that allow it to act reliably and consistently on behalf of a user:\\n\\n01\\n\\nIt leverages an LLM to manage workflow execution and make decisions. It recognizes when a workflow is complete and can proactively correct its actions if needed. In case \\u2028 of failure, it can halt execution and transfer control back to the user.\\n\\n02\\n\\nIt has access to various tools to interact with external systems—both to gather context and to take actions—and dynamically selects the appropriate tools depending on the workflow’s current state, always operating within clearly defined guardrails.\\n\\n4\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nWhen should you build an agent?\\n\\nBuilding agents requires rethinking how your systems make decisions and handle complexity. Unlike conventional automation, agents are uniquely suited to workflows where traditional deterministic and rule-based approaches fall short.\\n\\nConsider the example of payment fraud analysis. A traditional rules engine works like a checklist, flagging transactions based on preset criteria. In contrast, an LLM agent functions more like a seasoned investigator, evaluating context, considering subtle patterns, and identifying suspicious activity even when clear-cut rules aren’t violated. This nuanced reasoning capability is exactly what enables agents to manage complex, ambiguous situations effectively.\\n\\nAs you evaluate where agents can add value, prioritize workflows that have previously resisted automation, especially where traditional methods encounter friction:\\n\\n01\\n\\nComplex \\u2028 decision-making:\\n\\nWorkflows involving nuanced judgment, exceptions, or \\u2028 context-sensitive decisions, for example refund approval \\u2028 in customer service workflows.\\n\\n02\\n\\nDifficult-to-maintain rules:\\n\\nSystems that have become unwieldy due to extensive and intricate rulesets, making updates costly or error-prone, \\u2028 for example performing vendor security reviews.\\n\\n03\\n\\nHeavy reliance on unstructured data:\\n\\nScenarios that involve interpreting natural language, \\u2028 extracting meaning from documents, or interacting with \\u2028 users conversationally, for example processing a home insurance claim.\\n\\nBefore committing to building an agent, validate that your use case can meet these criteria clearly. Otherwise, a deterministic solution may suffice.\\n\\n6\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nAgent design foundations\\n\\nIn its most fundamental form, an agent consists of three core components:\\n\\n01\\n\\nModel\\n\\nThe LLM powering the agent’s reasoning and decision-making\\n\\n02\\n\\nTools\\n\\nExternal functions or APIs the agent can use to take action\\n\\n03\\n\\nInstructions\\n\\nExplicit guidelines and guardrails defining how the \\u2028 agent behaves\\n\\nHere’s what this looks like in code when using OpenAI’s Agents SDK. You can also implement the same concepts using your preferred library or building directly from scratch.\\n\\nPython\\n\\n1\\n\\nweather_agent = Agent(\\n\\n2\\n\\nname=\\n\\n\"Weather agent\"\\n\\n,\\n\\n3\\n\\ninstructions=\\n\\n\"You are a helpful agent who can talk to users about the\\n\\n4\\n\\nweather.\",\\n\\n5\\n\\ntools=[get_weather],\\n\\n6\\n\\n)\\n\\n7\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nSelecting your models\\n\\nDifferent models have different strengths and tradeoffs related to task complexity, latency, and cost. As we’ll see in the next section on Orchestration, you might want to consider using a variety \\u2028 of models for different tasks in the workflow.\\n\\nNot every task requires the smartest model—a simple retrieval or intent classification task may be handled by a smaller, faster model, while harder tasks like deciding whether to approve a refund may benefit from a more capable model.\\n\\nAn approach that works well is to build your agent prototype with the most capable model for every task to establish a performance baseline. From there, try swapping in smaller models to see \\u2028 if they still achieve acceptable results. This way, you don’t prematurely limit the agent’s abilities, and you can diagnose where smaller models succeed or fail.\\n\\nIn summary, the principles for choosing a model are simple:\\n\\n01\\n\\nSet up evals to establish a performance baseline\\n\\n02\\n\\nFocus on meeting your accuracy target with the best models available\\n\\n03\\n\\nOptimize for cost and latency by replacing larger models with smaller ones \\u2028 where possible\\n\\nYou can find a comprehensive guide to selecting OpenAI models here.\\n\\n8\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nDefining tools\\n\\nTools extend your agent’s capabilities by using APIs from underlying applications or systems. For legacy systems without APIs, agents can rely on computer-use models to interact directly with those applications and systems through web and application UIs—just as a human would.\\n\\nEach tool should have a standardized definition, enabling flexible, many-to-many relationships between tools and agents. Well-documented, thoroughly tested, and reusable tools improve discoverability, simplify version management, and prevent redundant definitions.\\n\\nBroadly speaking, agents need three types of tools:\\n\\nType\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nData\\n\\nEnable agents to retrieve context and information necessary for executing the workflow.\\n\\nQuery transaction databases or systems like CRMs, read PDF documents, or search the web.\\n\\nAction\\n\\nEnable agents to interact with systems to take actions such as adding new information to databases, updating records, or sending messages.\\n\\nSend emails and texts, update a CRM record, hand-off a customer service ticket to a human.\\n\\nOrchestration\\n\\nAgents themselves can serve as tools for other agents—see the Manager Pattern in the Orchestration section.\\n\\nRefund agent, Research agent, Writing agent.\\n\\n9\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nFor example, here’s how you would equip the agent defined above with a series of tools when using the Agents SDK:\\n\\nPython\\n\\n1\\n\\nfrom\\n\\nagents\\n\\nimport\\n\\nAgent, WebSearchTool, function_tool\\n\\n2\\n\\n@function_tool\\n\\n3\\n\\ndef\\n\\nsave_results(output):\\n\\n4\\n\\ndb.insert({\\n\\n\"output\"\\n\\n: output,\\n\\n\"timestamp\"\\n\\n: datetime.time()})\\n\\n5\\n\\nreturn \"File saved\"\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\nsearch_agent = Agent(\\n\\n8\\n\\nname=\\n\\n\"Search agent\"\\n\\n,\\n\\n8\\n\\ninstructions=\\n\\n\"Help the user search the internet and save results if\\n\\n10\\n\\nasked.\",\\n\\n11\\n\\ntools=[WebSearchTool(),save_results],\\n\\n12\\n\\n)\\n\\nAs the number of required tools increases, consider splitting tasks across multiple agents \\u2028 (see Orchestration).\\n\\n10\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nConfiguring instructions\\n\\nHigh-quality instructions are essential for any LLM-powered app, but especially critical for agents. Clear instructions reduce ambiguity and improve agent decision-making, resulting in smoother workflow execution and fewer errors.\\n\\nBest practices for agent instructions\\n\\nUse existing documents\\n\\nWhen creating routines, use existing operating procedures, support scripts, or policy documents to create LLM-friendly routines. In customer service for example, routines can roughly map to individual articles in your knowledge base.\\n\\nPrompt agents to break \\u2028 down tasks\\n\\nProviding smaller, clearer steps from dense resources \\u2028 helps minimize ambiguity and helps the model better \\u2028 follow instructions.\\n\\nDefine clear actions\\n\\nMake sure every step in your routine corresponds to a specific action or output. For example, a step might instruct the agent to ask the user for their order number or to call an API to retrieve account details. Being explicit about the action (and even the wording of a user-facing message) leaves less room \\u2028 for errors in interpretation.\\n\\nCapture edge cases\\n\\nReal-world interactions often create decision points such as how to proceed when a user provides incomplete information \\u2028 or asks an unexpected question. A robust routine anticipates common variations and includes instructions on how to handle them with conditional steps or branches such as an alternative step if a required piece of info is missing.\\n\\n11\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nYou can use advanced models, like o1 or o3-mini, to automatically generate instructions from existing documents. Here’s a sample prompt illustrating this approach:\\n\\nUnset\\n\\n1\\n\\n“You are an expert in writing instructions for an LLM agent. Convert the following help center document into a clear set of instructions, written in a numbered list. The document will be a policy followed by an LLM. Ensure that there is no ambiguity, and that the instructions are written as directions for an agent. The help center document to convert is the following {{help_center_doc}}”\\n\\n12\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nOrchestration\\n\\nWith the foundational components in place, you can consider orchestration patterns to enable \\u2028 your agent to execute workflows effectively.\\n\\nWhile it’s tempting to immediately build a fully autonomous agent with complex architecture, customers typically achieve greater success with an incremental approach.\\n\\nIn general, orchestration patterns fall into two categories:\\n\\n01\\n\\nSingle-agent systems, where a single model equipped with appropriate tools and instructions executes workflows in a loop\\n\\n02\\n\\nMulti-agent systems, where workflow execution is distributed across multiple coordinated agents\\n\\nLet’s explore each pattern in detail.\\n\\n13\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nSingle-agent systems\\n\\nA single agent can handle many tasks by incrementally adding tools, keeping complexity manageable and simplifying evaluation and maintenance. Each new tool expands its capabilities without prematurely forcing you to orchestrate multiple agents.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nAgent\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nInstructions\\n\\nTools\\n\\nGuardrails\\n\\nHooks\\n\\nEvery orchestration approach needs the concept of a ‘run’, typically implemented as a loop that lets agents operate until an exit condition is reached. Common exit conditions include tool calls, \\u2028 a certain structured output, errors, or reaching a maximum number of turns.\\n\\n14\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nFor example, in the Agents SDK, agents are started using the over the LLM until either:\\n\\nRunner.run()\\n\\nmethod, which loops\\n\\n01\\n\\nA final-output tool is invoked, defined by a specific output type\\n\\n02\\n\\nThe model returns a response without any tool calls (e.g., a direct user message)\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\nPython\\n\\n1\\n\\nAgents.run(agent, [UserMessage(\\n\\n\"What\\'s the capital of the USA?\"\\n\\n)])\\n\\nThis concept of a while loop is central to the functioning of an agent. In multi-agent systems, as you’ll see next, you can have a sequence of tool calls and handoffs between agents but allow the model to run multiple steps until an exit condition is met.\\n\\nAn effective strategy for managing complexity without switching to a multi-agent framework is to use prompt templates. Rather than maintaining numerous individual prompts for distinct use cases, use a single flexible base prompt that accepts policy variables. This template approach adapts easily to various contexts, significantly simplifying maintenance and evaluation. As new use cases arise, you can update variables rather than rewriting entire workflows.\\n\\nUnset\\n\\n1\\n\\n\"\"\" You are a call center agent. You are interacting with {{user_first_name}} who has been a member for {{user_tenure}}. The user\\'s most common complains are about {{user_complaint_categories}}. Greet the user, thank them for being a loyal customer, and answer any questions the user may have!\\n\\n15\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nWhen to consider creating multiple agents\\n\\nOur general recommendation is to maximize a single agent’s capabilities first. More agents can provide intuitive separation of concepts, but can introduce additional complexity and overhead, \\u2028 so often a single agent with tools is sufficient.\\n\\nFor many complex workflows, splitting up prompts and tools across multiple agents allows for improved performance and scalability. When your agents fail to follow complicated instructions \\u2028 or consistently select incorrect tools, you may need to further divide your system and introduce more distinct agents.\\n\\nPractical guidelines for splitting agents include:\\n\\nComplex logic\\n\\nWhen prompts contain many conditional statements \\u2028 (multiple if-then-else branches), and prompt templates get difficult to scale, consider dividing each logical segment across separate agents.\\n\\nTool overload\\n\\nThe issue isn’t solely the number of tools, but their similarity \\u2028 or overlap. Some implementations successfully manage \\u2028 more than 15 well-defined, distinct tools while others struggle with fewer than 10 overlapping tools. Use multiple agents \\u2028 if improving tool clarity by providing descriptive names, \\u2028 clear parameters, and detailed descriptions doesn’t \\u2028 improve performance.\\n\\n16\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nMulti-agent systems\\n\\nWhile multi-agent systems can be designed in numerous ways for specific workflows and requirements, our experience with customers highlights two broadly applicable categories:\\n\\nManager (agents as tools)\\n\\nA central “manager” agent coordinates multiple specialized agents via tool calls, each handling a specific task or domain.\\n\\nDecentralized (agents handing off to agents)\\n\\nMultiple agents operate as peers, handing off tasks to one another based on their specializations.\\n\\nMulti-agent systems can be modeled as graphs, with agents represented as nodes. In the manager pattern, edges represent tool calls whereas in the decentralized pattern, edges represent handoffs that transfer execution between agents.\\n\\nRegardless of the orchestration pattern, the same principles apply: keep components flexible, composable, and driven by clear, well-structured prompts.\\n\\n17\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nManager pattern\\n\\nThe manager pattern empowers a central LLM—the “manager”—to orchestrate a network of specialized agents seamlessly through tool calls. Instead of losing context or control, the manager intelligently delegates tasks to the right agent at the right time, effortlessly synthesizing the results into a cohesive interaction. This ensures a smooth, unified user experience, with specialized capabilities always available on-demand.\\n\\nThis pattern is ideal for workflows where you only want one agent to control workflow execution and have access to the user.\\n\\nTranslate ‘hello’ to Spanish, French and Italian for me!\\n\\nTask\\n\\nSpanish agent\\n\\nManager\\n\\nTask\\n\\nFrench agent\\n\\n...\\n\\nTask\\n\\nItalian agent\\n\\n18\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nFor example, here’s how you could implement this pattern in the Agents SDK:\\n\\nPython\\n\\n1\\n\\nfrom\\n\\nagents\\n\\nimport\\n\\nAgent, Runner\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\nmanager_agent = Agent(\\n\\n4\\n\\nname=\\n\\n\"manager_agent\"\\n\\n,\\n\\n5\\n\\ninstructions=(\\n\\n6\\n\\n\"You are a translation agent.

While beneficial for visual clarity, this approach can quickly become cumbersome and challenging as workflows grow more dynamic and complex, often necessitating the learning of specialized domain-specific languages.\\n\\nIn contrast, the Agents SDK adopts a more flexible, code-first approach. Developers can \\u2028 directly express workflow logic using familiar programming constructs without needing to \\u2028 pre-define the entire graph upfront, enabling more dynamic and adaptable agent orchestration.\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nDecentralized pattern\\n\\nIn a decentralized pattern, agents can ‘handoff’ workflow execution to one another. Handoffs are a one way transfer that allow an agent to delegate to another agent. In the Agents SDK, a handoff is a type of tool, or function. If an agent calls a handoff function, we immediately start execution on that new agent that was handed off to while also transferring the latest conversation state.\\n\\nThis pattern involves using many agents on equal footing, where one agent can directly hand \\u2028 off control of the workflow to another agent. This is optimal when you don’t need a single agent maintaining central control or synthesis—instead allowing each agent to take over execution and interact with the user as needed.\\n\\nIssues and Repairs\\n\\nWhere is my order?\\n\\nTriage\\n\\nSales\\n\\nOn its way!\\n\\nOrders\\n\\n21\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nFor example, here’s how you’d implement the decentralized pattern using the Agents SDK for \\u2028 a customer service workflow that handles both sales and support:\\n\\nPython\\n\\n1\\n\\nfrom\\n\\nagents\\n\\nimport\\n\\nAgent, Runner\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\ntechnical_support_agent = Agent(\\n\\n4\\n\\nname=\\n\\n\"Technical Support Agent\",\\n\\n5\\n\\ninstructions=(\\n\\n6\\n\\n\"You provide expert assistance with resolving technical issues,\\n\\n7\\n\\nsystem outages, or product troubleshooting.\"\\n\\n8\\n\\n),\\n\\n9\\n\\ntools=[search_knowledge_base]\\n\\n10\\n\\n)\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\nsales_assistant_agent = Agent(\\n\\n13\\n\\nname=\\n\\n\"Sales Assistant Agent\"\\n\\n,\\n\\n14\\n\\ninstructions=(\\n\\n15\\n\\n\"You help enterprise clients browse the product catalog, recommend\\n\\n16\\n\\nsuitable solutions, and facilitate purchase transactions.\"\\n\\n17\\n\\n),\\n\\n18\\n\\ntools=[initiate_purchase_order]\\n\\n19\\n\\n)\\n\\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\norder_management_agent = Agent(\\n\\n22\\n\\nname=\\n\\n\"Order Management Agent\"\\n\\n,\\n\\n23\\n\\ninstructions=(\\n\\n24\\n\\n\"You assist clients with inquiries regarding order tracking,\\n\\n25\\n\\ndelivery schedules, and processing returns or refunds.\"\\n\\n22\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\n26\\n\\n),\\n\\n27\\n\\ntools=[track_order_status, initiate_refund_process]\\n\\n28\\n\\n)\\n\\n29\\n\\n30\\n\\ntriage_agent = Agent(\\n\\n31\\n\\nname=Triage Agent\",\\n\\n32\\n\\ninstructions=\\n\\n\"You act as the first point of contact, assessing customer\\n\\n33\\n\\nqueries and directing them promptly to the correct specialized agent.\"\\n\\n,\\n\\n34\\n\\nhandoffs=[technical_support_agent, sales_assistant_agent,\\n\\n35\\n\\norder_management_agent],\\n\\n36\\n\\n)\\n\\n37\\n\\n38\\n\\nawait\\n\\nRunner.run(\\n\\n39\\n\\ntriage_agent,\\n\\n40\\n\\ninput\\n\\n(\\n\\n\"Could you please provide an update on the delivery timeline for\\n\\n41\\n\\nour recent purchase?\"\\n\\n)\\n\\n42\\n\\n)\\n\\nIn the above example, the initial user message is sent to triage_agent. Recognizing that \\u2028 the input concerns a recent purchase, the triage_agent would invoke a handoff to the order_management_agent, transferring control to it.\\n\\nThis pattern is especially effective for scenarios like conversation triage, or whenever you prefer specialized agents to fully take over certain tasks without the original agent needing to remain involved. Optionally, you can equip the second agent with a handoff back to the original agent, allowing it to transfer control again if necessary.\\n\\n23\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nGuardrails\\n\\nWell-designed guardrails help you manage data privacy risks (for example, preventing system prompt leaks) or reputational risks (for example, enforcing brand aligned model behavior). \\u2028 You can set up guardrails that address risks you’ve already identified for your use case and layer \\u2028 in additional ones as you uncover new vulnerabilities. Guardrails are a critical component of any LLM-based deployment, but should be coupled with robust authentication and authorization protocols, strict access controls, and standard software security measures.\\n\\n24\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nThink of guardrails as a layered defense mechanism.

Under this approach, the primary agent proactively generates outputs while guardrails \\u2028 run concurrently, triggering exceptions if constraints are breached.\\n\\nGuardrails can be implemented as functions or agents that enforce policies such as jailbreak prevention, relevance validation, keyword filtering, blocklist enforcement, or safety classification. For example, the agent above processes a math question input optimistically until the math_homework_tripwire guardrail identifies a violation and raises an exception.\\n\\nPlan for human intervention\\n\\nHuman intervention is a critical safeguard enabling you to improve an agent’s real-world performance without compromising user experience. It’s especially important early \\u2028 in deployment, helping identify failures, uncover edge cases, and establish a robust evaluation cycle.\\n\\nImplementing a human intervention mechanism allows the agent to gracefully transfer control when it can’t complete a task. In customer service, this means escalating the issue \\u2028 to a human agent. For a coding agent, this means handing control back to the user.\\n\\nTwo primary triggers typically warrant human intervention:\\n\\nExceeding failure thresholds: Set limits on agent retries or actions. If the agent exceeds\\u2028 these limits (e.g., fails to understand customer intent after multiple attempts), escalate\\u2028 to human intervention.\\n\\nHigh-risk actions: Actions that are sensitive, irreversible, or have high stakes should\\u2028 trigger human oversight until confidence in the agent’s reliability grows. Examples\\u2028 include canceling user orders, authorizing large refunds, or making payments.\\n\\n31\\n\\nA practical guide to building agents\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAgents mark a new era in workflow automation, where systems can reason through ambiguity, take action across tools, and handle multi-step tasks with a high degree of autonomy. Unlike simpler LLM applications, agents execute workflows end-to-end, making them well-suited for use cases that involve complex decisions, unstructured data, or brittle rule-based systems.\\n\\nTo build reliable agents, start with strong foundations: pair capable models with well-defined tools and clear, structured instructions. Use orchestration patterns that match your complexity level, starting with a single agent and evolving to multi-agent systems only when needed. Guardrails are critical at every stage, from input filtering and tool use to human-in-the-loop intervention, helping ensure agents operate safely and predictably in production.\\n\\nThe path to successful deployment isn’t all-or-nothing. Start small, validate with real users, and grow capabilities over time. With the right foundations and an iterative approach, agents can deliver real business value—automating not just tasks, but entire workflows with intelligence \\u2028 and adaptability.\\n\\nIf you’re exploring agents for your organization or preparing for your first deployment, feel free \\u2028 to reach out.

      "- **Adaptability:** You need a system that can adapt to changing situations or user needs without requiring extensive reprogramming.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Decision-Making:** The system needs to make decisions based on real-time data and context, rather than following a predetermined set of rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Proactivity:** Your system needs to take initiative, such as identifying when tasks are complete, correcting errors, or escalating issues when necessary.\n",

      "- **Integration with External Systems:** The tasks require interaction with various external systems and APIs to gather information or take actions, which an agent can handle dynamically.\n",

      "Chain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\n",
      "Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\n",

      "Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\n",
